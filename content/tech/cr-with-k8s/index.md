[DeepSource](https://deepsource.com) regularly hosts meetups on the office terrace. In true programmer style, they are named `.meetup/<theme>`! It was at one such `.meetup/kubernetes` in January that I got the chance to present a talk on my work in Google Summer of Code 2022 (you can read about that [here](/tech/my-gsoc-journey)). I was also lucky enough to have the talk recorded and uploaded to YouTube :)

In case you're too lazy (or busy) to watch the entire video, you can scrub through the slides [here](/slides/dot-meetup-k8s-2023).
