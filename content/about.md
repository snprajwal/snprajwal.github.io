To try and answer this in a way that will (hopefully) make you pause for a second before you close this page is a tedious job, to say the least. But I will do my best.

I am a distinct potpourri of seemingly random interests and abilities, which nonetheless tie together into a giant connected graph at some obscure level. I am a formally trained Karnatik classical vocalist and mridangam artist. Across the years, I have also picked up a motley assortment of other musical skills including the guitar, flute, and a wide range of percussion instruments (trust me to start drumming on *literally* anything I find in my vicinity). I am an origami artist, and love to surprise people with a pocket-sized bookmark or tessellation when I meet them (see my folds [here](/folds)). In my school and college days, you would usually spot me fiddling with a Rubik's cube at any given point of time (the friends who managed to tolerate me can attest to this), and I can proudly claim a personal best of 6.63 seconds to solve the 3x3 cube. As an insufferable memelord, you can expect me to spice up conversations with witty puns, subtle jokes, and the occasional ridiculous meme from the depths of Reddit.

I can't just do nothing. I have never been able to "waste time", so as to speak, and am most adept at getting bored to death exceptionally quickly. This quirk, combined with an insatiable hunger for knowledge, makes me go out of my comfort zone and explore topics that have absolutely no connection to anything in my life. I voraciously **consoom** information in all forms, but prefer written media as it lets me control the speed of processing the material (yes I watch videos at 1.5x with subtitles, don't judge). Naturally, I am a chronic reader, and always a carry a book with me lest I end up in a situation where I run out of things to do. On those rare days when I can afford the luxury of extended free time, you will find me unearthing nondescript movies, watching outlandish documentaries, or having an animated discussion about the previous two with one of my close friends.

If you have taken the time and spare brain cells to read until here, you have my gratitude. I am always interested in getting to know new people, and would love to hear from you, be it a simple "Hi" or an elaborate dissertation on your journey that miraculously brought you to this website. You are welcome to contact me either through email or on any of the other platforms that you manage to locate me on (fair warning, I do *not* use social media consistently, so expect a delayed reply).
